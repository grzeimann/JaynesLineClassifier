# API Reference (stub)

This section will host the API reference for the `jlc` package.

Planned approach:
- Keep this page as a landing stub for now.
- In a future iteration, integrate an automated reference (e.g., with `mkdocstrings` or Sphinx + MyST) to pull docstrings from:
  - `jlc.engine`
  - `jlc.labels` (LAELabel, OIILabel, FakeLabel, LabelRegistry)
  - `jlc.simulate` (PPP and simple simulators)
  - `jlc.rates.observed_space`
  - `jlc.selection`
  - `jlc.population.schechter`

Until then, consult the source and the Algorithms section for conceptual details.
